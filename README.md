# Portable PS Monitor Website (PPSMW)

A website generated by PowerShell to monitor devices (Physical/Virtual/Virtual Host (specifically Hyper-v)). Either keep a constant ping or get some basic details of the remote devices. In order to get the remote details, the script assume network credentials are available for all monitored resources.

### Example Command

> Invoke-PPSMWOrchestration -RootDirectoryPath "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PPSMW" -SourceFiles "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PortablePSMonitorWebSite" -Devices (Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\AllComputers.txt")

> [!NOTE]
> The module will have to be imported first. Also, if you run into an issue with the individual pages not being created, that is due to one of the script not being imported when trying to run jobs. Working on that. Best suggesting is to add the folder to a path that is within your PowerShell $env:PATH.
